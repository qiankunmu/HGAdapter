This the source code implementation of HGAdapter: Hypergraph-based Structural Adapter Fine-tuning Pre-Trained Model.  
Due to the paper being under peer review, in accordance with the principle of anonymity, we temporarily withhold the title and content of the paper.

Due to time constraints, we have not prepared a user-friendly parameter command for running the code.  
Our implementation of the HGAdapter is located in the `models` folder.  
Our traing code are in trainXXX.py.  
The datasets and pre-trained models need to download. We give related reference in paper.  
You can modify parameters in trainXXX.py.  
We will optimize the code to make it easier for users to run directly later.
