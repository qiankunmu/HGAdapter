# HGAdapter

We have provided the source code implementation.  
Due to time constraints, we have not prepared a user-friendly parameter command for running the code.  
Our implementation of the HGAdapter is located in the `models` folder.  
Our traing code are in trainXXX.py.  
The datasets and pre-trained models need to download. We give related reference in paper.  
You can modify parameters in trainXXX.py.  
If paper is accepted, the code will be published in Github.  
We will optimize the code to make it easier for users to run directly in future.
